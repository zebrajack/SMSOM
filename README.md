# Notice

This is a bug fix version because the initial version is not consistent with the description in the paper (found by contributors), but is not tested. If you come across errors, please play with
the initial version first by `git checkout 1d486abd4d61c89c787fb05bf1f1226b067deb9b`.

# How to use


### For Windows users:

If you have a working environment of OpenCV 2.4.5, CUDA 5.0, Visual Studio 2010, Windows 7 (64 bit), then you can use this repository directly. The executable is **.\Debug\smsom.exe**; therefore, you should first use **cmd** in Windows to navigate to the directory **Debug**. Please ENSURE smsom can find OpenCV library, and you have CUDA compatible GPU installed in your computer.


Then you have two options:

* If you have foreground free traning images, then execute:

  `smsom train <start_frame_number> <end_frame_number> <input_file_name> <output_file_name>`

  where `<start_frame_number>` and `<end_frame_number>` stand for the index range of the training images; `<input_file_name>`     is the format of the input image's name, and the last parameter `<output_file_name>` is optional, if you omit it, then the output images are just shown in your screen, but not stored in your computer.

  For example, if I put the input images in: **E:\Data\input\**,
  the image files' name format is: **in000001.jpg** (any number), and I use 1-100 images to train the model, then I can execute:

  `smsom train 1 100 E:\\Data\\input\\in%06d.jpg E:\\Data\\results\\bin%06d.jpg`

  where I put the result images in **E:\Data\results**.

  or

  `smsom train 1 100 E:\\Data\\input\\in%06d.jpg`

  where I do not store the output images.

* If you do not have foreground free training images, you can execute:

  `smsom nottrain <input_file_name> <output_file_name>`

  where the meanings of `<input_file_name>` and `<output_file_name>` (optional) are the same as the previous case. In this situation, we set the threshold tau=0.06 (see **[1]** for more details).

### For Linux users:


You have to build yourself. Please ENSURE you have installed OpenCV and CUDA. See **[1]** for how to use CUDA on Linux platform. Then you can navigate to **./src/**, and execute the following commands in order:

`cmake .`

`make`

The usage of the generated executable `smsom` is the same as the commands shown previously in Windows. (You may use `./smsom <parameters>` instead of `smsom <parameters>`)

------------------------------------------------------------

# Demos

Some demo scripts are shown as follows (assuming you have decompressed dataset **[2]** in **E:\Data\**):

* fountain01: ``smsom train 1 399 E:\\Data\\dynamicBackground\\fountain01\\input\\in%06d.jpg``
* highway: ``smsom nottrain E:\\Data\\baseline\\highway\\input\\in%06d.jpg``
* traffic: ``smsom train 129 200 E:\\Data\\cameraJitter\\traffic\\input\\in%06d.jpg``
* ladeSide: ``smsom train 1 999 E:\\Data\\thermal\\lakeSide\\input\\in%06d.jpg``

------------------------------------------------------------

# Post-processing and quantitative evaluation

You should use the Matlab script **.\tools\median_filter.m** to do a 5X5 median filtering as suggested in **[2]**.
